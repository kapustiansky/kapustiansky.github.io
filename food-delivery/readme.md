    =================================> General information <=====================================
    -assembly based on a real project, so the file structure is exactly like this;
    -all images are taken from the layout with the appropriate quality;
    -image optimization was not carried out, since it depends on what the project will be on (static, php, js library);-conversion to modern image formats, compression, use of the picture tag:
            -if the layout is for statics, then you can use additional plugins for Galp.
            -else optimization and image processing will depend on the framework/platform
